## Open your customizations

 [Random image illustrating customization]
AEM development has always been about customizations, from the obvious need to own your design to the way the content is handled.

Problems around it are mostly that :
- a customization is not always needed,
- a customization can be done over and over again across AEM deployments

this happens because sometimes either you don't know something exist in the product, or how you could tweak the requirements to fit the product in,
or either you really are not happy with how it handles it.
The same goes with other's customizations / features.

We count on opening our customization to be a good filter for this

 [Diagram with our sites, corp.dexter, dx, core components contrib, aem core components, wcm.io, sling, acs, and random others]
One question that could be asked to us is where do we stand in regards to other existing open sourced frameworks. 
The answer is that we don't know for most of it! More seriously we don't plan on a fixed position, but so sit on top of core components, 
wcm.io mocks, and sling of course. More generally each new feature would not be a fixed spot on a complicated diagram, but rather the beginning of 
the beautiful cycle of the open sourcing.  

 [Cycle diagram] : Factorization -> Break down in open bits (products, partner, custom) -> Usage -> Factorization 
 
 Opening a customization starts by factorizing our own needs to the point it's generic enough to be usable by others. Once there, 
 some bits of it might bubble to core components or wcm.io, parts of it to sling. We can do it because it's open, available from a URL for 
 discussion and thoughts.
 If no custom code is left after that "ascension", that's good for us, otherwise it's another feature someone can use on his side.
