# Chris - Welcome
## Our Faces & Titles

## Preface
We are not the product team. We are AEM users just like many of you.

## Introduction
After years of requests, we're making many adobe.com features open source.

We're calling the project Adobe Dx, for Adobe Digital Experience... or Dexter if you're nasty.

# Nicolas - Motivations

## Why Us?
Why do we exist in a world of Core Components, ACS Commons, wcm.io, etc?

We don't know!

More seriously we don't have a fixed position. We sit on top of core components, wcm.io mocks, and sling of course. 

More generally each new feature would not be a fixed spot on a complicated diagram, but rather the beginning of the beautiful cycle of the open sourcing.

On adobe.com, we believe the best ideas ship. Bringing our ideas into the open means the AEM community can have this conversation at a much larger scale.

**Example:** We initialy thought Core Components would be a good home for our Flex Container component. What we found was that the services to power it did not seem like a good fit, so we decided to contribute it to Adobe Dx. Will this change in the future? Maybe. Today we are less focused on where and more focused on the what.

* Circle 1 - Core Components - Mostly just components
* Circle 2 - ACS Commons - Kitchen Sink (better / nicer way to say this?)
* Circle 3 - Adobe Dx - Tools [1] for building exceptional digital experiences

## Customizations

[Random image illustrating customization]

AEM development has always been about customizations, from the obvious need to own your design to the way the content is handled.

### Problems
* A customization is not always needed
* A customization can be done over and over again across AEM deployments

### Why this happens
* You don't know something exist in the product
* Or how you could tweak the requirements to fit the product in.
* Or you really are not happy with how it handles it.

The same goes with other's customizations / features.

### Adobe Dx is aimed at:
* Filtering these ideas and requirements
* Bring a world-class filtered set of features into the open
* Spark conversations around adobe.com customizations in a more public forum



[Diagram of development process] : Factorization -> Break down in open bits (products, partner, custom) -> Usage -> Factorization 
 
Opening a customization starts by factorizing our own needs to the point it's generic enough to be usable by others. Once there, some bits of it might bubble to core components or wcm.io, parts of it to sling. We can do it because it's open, available from a URL for discussion and thoughts. If no custom code is left after that "ascension", that's good for us, otherwise it's another feature someone can use on their site.

# Chris - What Adobe Dx actually is today
## High Level Requirements
* Performant
* Tested (80% coverage, blah blah blah)
* Embodies the spirit of open source
* AEM as a Cloud Service first-class citizen
* Battle tested by adobe.com

## What's in it - w/ Brief Descriptions
"We're going to rapid-fire demo all these, but we wanted to briefly describe them."

* Flex Container - World Class flexbox Component
* Parlite - Obessively Performant Parsys (supports style system)
* Config Manager - An extensible cloud config manager
  * Adobe Fonts - Adobe Fonts for Sites
  * Gradients - Shareable gradients
  * Marketo - No-fuss Marketo REST integration
* ID Tagger - Persistent IDs resilient to page refactoring
* Marketo
